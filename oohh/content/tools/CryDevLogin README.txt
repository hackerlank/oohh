Here's something SirKane from the Ink team has been working on; an automated version of the CryDevLogin application shipped with the Free SDK. Using this application, you can start CryENGINE without the need to manually log into CryDev.

Installation:
Download the executable here
Replace the existing CryDevLogin.exe in your CE install's Tools directory
Start the Editor!

Note: this does not remove the log requirement, it merely removes the necessity to log in manually at Editor / Launcher start-up.
