run generate.bat and input your cryengine3sdk path

project files will be outputted to your cryengine3 root in a folder named "oohh_project_files"

premake issues:
	vs20xx:
		premake sets the debugger target to CryGame.dll, so you need to make it open launcher.exe instead if you want the quick debug features like f5
		the filter will be created based on the full path, to fix this just drag the content out of it
